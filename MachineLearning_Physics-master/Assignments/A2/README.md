The deadline is April 16th  
=========================



Let’s build a classifier!


•	You should develop your own classifier and you should use all things that you have learned from the course until now.

•	It is recommended to develop a logistic regression model that outputs the probability of different classes.

•	It is recommended to develop an object-oriented implementation, where similar to the scikit-learn library, the classifier is an object with functions for training and predictions (i.e. predict(), fit(), and so on).

•	It must have the capability of using different loss functions (penalty) and different optimization methods which can be assigned to the model.

•	Then choose a dataset and test your model. Try it with different loss functions and optimization methods.
